# HitMarkers
A simple plugin displaying a symbol inside your crosshair everytime you hit an enemy, just like in Call of Duty. Made this plugin since there aren't any of this kind yet. The plugin is standard set to display a hitmarker when using any gun. set amx_hmsnipers "1" to enable it for only snipers.
